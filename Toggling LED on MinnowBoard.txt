Summary

In this guide, I will describe how to toggle an user LED on the MinnowBoard step by step. This guide targets beginners who are just getting started on the MinnowBoard. 



Contents of the box

When you purchase a MinnowBoard, you get the following items in the box as shown in Figure -1:

1. MinnowBoard

2. 5V Power Connector

3. 4GB microSD card preloaded with Angstrom Distribution(Yocto Project compatible)

Anatomy of a MinnowBoard

This section briefly describes the various different components on the MinnowBoard. Figure -2 below annotates the different components on the top side of the MinnowBoard.

Preparing the MicroSD Card

Note:- This section is for linux users only. If you are using Windows, please skip to the [sec:Windows-Users]

Please note that this section is completely optional. The MinnowBoard already comes with a microSD card that is preloaded with a working Angstrom image. In any case should you want a newer image or want to program the microSD card again, this section covers it all. For the purpose of this guide, I have used an Ubuntu 12.10 64 bit system.

• First download the latest Angstrom image for MinnowBoard from the link below:

http://dominion.thruhere.net/koen/angstrom/minnow/Angstrom-development-GNOME-image-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-minnow-2013.05.24.img.xz

At the time of writing this guide, the latest image available for download was 'Angstrom-development-GNOME-image-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-minnow-2013.05.24.img.xz' 

• Now, identify the correct raw device name (like /dev/sde - not /dev/sde1) for the microSD card. You can do this by opening disk utility in Ubuntu and clicking on the microSD card. 

• Now unpack the image to the microSD card by writing the following command in the terminal:

$ xzcat Angstrom-development-GNOME-image-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-minnow-2013.05.24.img.xz | sudo dcfldd of=/dev/sdc

Here 'sdX' stands for the device id of the microSD card.



User LED on the MinnowBoard

There are a total of five LED(s) on the MinnowBoard namely D11, D12, D13, D14, D15 as shown in Figure -2. Their functions have been described in the table below:

 Figure-4: LED(s) on the MinnowBoard

So, there are two USER LED(s) on the MinnowBoard namely D11 and D12 but by default they cannot be used as USER LED(s). 

The user LED(s) are accessible via the user space in Linux at the location below on the filesystem:

/sys/class/leds

There is one directory per user LED, named as shown below: 

/sys/class/leds/minnow_led0
/sys/class/leds/minnow_led1

Here, led0 is D11 while led1 is D12. Inside each one of those directories, there is a file named "brightness". If you write a "1" or a "0" to this file, then you can control the status of that led, i.e. , toggle it ON or OFF respectively.



Extra Credit

This is an optional section which you can read for further understanding. In a nutshell, we are trying to access the on board USER LED(s) via the userspace[http://elinux.org/images/4/4f/02-linux-quick-start.pdf] in Linux. To be more precise we are trying to use the sysfs[http://www.makelinux.net/books/lkd2/ch17lev1sec8] interface. sysfs is a virtual filesystem which enumerates the devices and busses attached to the system(board in our case) into a file system hierarchy that can be accessed from userspace. It's generated by the kernel and always mounted at /sys. As discussed earlier, trigger for D11 and D12 LED(s) has to be changed to make them function as USER LED(s). I would describe 'trigger' as the API used to link a LED to an 'event' in kernel space. Here, 'event' could be microSD card or Ethernet activity, heartbeat, power etc. To understand this better, take LED D11 for example. The trigger for D11 has been set by default to heartbeat. So, to use it as an USER LED, we have to change the trigger for it to 'none' as shown in Figure - 5 below:

 Figure-5: Change LED Trigger



Booting Angstrom

• First insert the card into the microSD card slot as shown in Figure -6. 

 Figure-6: Connecting the microSD card

• Next, connect an external keyboard and mouse to the MinnowBoard. Then connect the USB mini cable to your computer and the MinnowBoard as shown in Figure -7

 Figure-7: Connecting the USB mini cable

• To power up the MinnowBoard, connect the 5V/3A power supply rated to it as shown in Figure -8:

 Figure-8: Powering up the MinnowBoard

• Access the MinnowBoard via the terminal:$ screen /dev/ttyUSB1 115200Note:- You can also use minicom. But this is just much easier! Also in most cases the virtual USB serial port is ttyUSB1. If it does not work, try ttyUSB0 .

• You should see a similar Angstrom login in screen as shown in Figure - 9. The username is 'root' and there is no password. Just press the enter key.

 Figure-9: Angstrom

Steps

• Now let us light that LED!

To use D11 as USER LED, we need to change its default trigger. Write the following command in your terminal to accomplish it:

echo none > /sys/class/leds/minnow_led0/trigger

Now we are ready to toggle the LED. Write the following commands in your terminal as shown in Figure - 10(First one is for turning ON and latter for OFF):

echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/minnow_led0/brightness

 Figure-10: Toggle the LED

You should get an output as shown below:

 Figure-11: Led ON

 Figure-12: LED OFF



Windows Users

This section is for those who are using a windows machine to interact with the MinnowBoard. 

Serial Terminal

We will be using Teraterm as our terminal application. Please follow the steps below to set up Teraterm:

• Download the latest version of Teraterm from the link below:

http://en.sourceforge.jp/projects/ttssh2/releases/

At the time of writing this guide the latest version was 'teraterm-4.78.exe'

• Install the Teraterm software by double clicking on the exe file downloaded earlier. If it displays a security warning, then accept it and click on 'Run' as shown in Figure - 13 below:

 Figure-13: Teraterm installation

• Then just follow the on-screen instructions to install the software. It is advised to do the 'full' installation instead of the 'standard' one as shown in Figure - 14 below:

 Figure-14: Perform Teraterm full installation

• Launch Teraterm. Then go to Setup>Serial port and change the settings as shown in Figure - 15 below:

 Figure-15: Teraterm Serial Port setup

• Then go to File>New connections and select the Serial option and chose the appropriate COM port as shown in Figure - 16 below

 Figure-16: Setting up a new connection

• Then connect the required accessories as described earlier in the guide and power up the MinnowBoard. If all went well, you should see a successful output in Teraterm as shown in Figure - 17 below:

Preparing the microSD Card

• First, download the latest Angstrom from the link below:

http://dominion.thruhere.net/koen/angstrom/minnow/Angstrom-development-GNOME-image-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-minnow-2013.06.04.img.xz

• Next, download 7-zip utility from the link below and install it:http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

• Decompress the previously downloaded Angstrom image using 7-zip as shown in Figure - 18 below. The resulting file should have an extension '.img' .

 Figure-18: Decompressing the image

• Now, install 'Image Writer for Windows' software from the link below:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download 

• Insert the mircoSD card into the computer using an appropriate connector. Next, launch the image writer software we just installed earlier. Select the Angstrom image and write it to the microSD card as shown in Figure - 19 below.
